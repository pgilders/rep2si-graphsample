    "### Problem statement\n",
    "* Given a directed graph `G`, find a subgraph `H` that is a directed regular graph (equal in-degree and out-degree) of degree `k` with all the same nodes as `G`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General approach\n",
    "* Some edges in `G` are more important to include (even necessary) in `H` than others in order to find a valid solution.\n",
    "* We assign each edge in `G` a score, based on the desired degree `k`, the current in/out-degree of the nodes it connects in `H`, and the in/out degree in `G`.\n",
    "* Add edges from `G` to `H`, roughly in order of decreasing score (with some added randomness / reassignment to avoid getting stuck with non-solutions), recalculating scores after each step, until `H` is a regular graph of degree `k`."

    "### Demo implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate some random graphs\n",
    "* First graphs are generated by creating a regular graph of degree `j` and then adding edges such that each node has out-degree `l` according to preferential attachment.\n",
    "* Next graphs are generated by preferential attachment where each node has out-degree `l`, but with rewiring such that each node has minimum in-degree `j`. Here there is not a guarantee that a regular subgraph exists.\n",
    "* The function `extract_regular_subgraph` takes a graph `G` and a desired degree `k` and attempts to find a subgraph `H` of `G` that is a regular graph of degree `k`.\n",
    "* The function `extract_regular_subgraph` is called on each of the generated graphs, for `k` between 1 and `j/2`, and results stored."
